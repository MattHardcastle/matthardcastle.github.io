# Privacy Policy

## Overview

The software industry has a reputation for collecting as much information as possible. In the best case, businesses use this information to market and improve their products.

Often this well-meaning limited collection grows into a privacy-invading behemoth. I believe these collection practices erode trust and harm our industry. I do not feed the behemoth and collect only that which is available from Apple as part of the App Store.

## Data Sharing

I do not share any data I collect from you with any entity, except as described in the “Services I Use” section below. As a person in the state of California in the U.S., I may be required by law to share data with law enforcement or other government agencies.

## Services I Use

Your data may be collected by third-party service I use when you purchase my apps or contact me for support. Here are links to their privacy policies:

[Apple](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/). Because my apps run on Apple’s devices, information about your use of my apps may be collected by Apple.

[Hover](https://www.hover.com/privacy). Hover is my email provider. If you email me for support, they will have access to the email.

## Customer Support

When you contact me for support via email to m@hardcastle.com, I store a copy of your inquiry, our response, and any follow-ups, on servers operated by Hover, a third-party service. I download these messages to my Apple devices, where they are stored and backed up to various encrypted drives, all under my control.
